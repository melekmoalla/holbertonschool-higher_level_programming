# Leight-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, python

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data
structures, algorithms, and other height-level programming concepts while
working in the python language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

## Requirements

The C scripts were compiled with **GCC 4.8.4**.

Some scripts need more specific requirements, but these will be shown where they are needed.
